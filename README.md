# An analysis of the gender gap in mobile and internet access in the world


## About the Project

On the surface, the internet appears to be a universally accessible and widely used instrument that has spread and established itself globally. This, however, is not the case. 

The Covid-19 pandemic brought this divide to the forefront. Many services, opportunities, tools, and educational resources that were previously available in-person to offline communities, became unavailable during the pandemic. Nearly half of the world was offline in 2020, with no internet connectivity. 

Women in Low- and Middle-Income Countries made up the majority of this offline population (LMICs). This project was created to bring attention to the digital gender gap and promote awareness of both the progress that has been done and the wide differences in access to digital and communications technology that exist around the world.

## Visualization Improvements

Taking the improvements into consideration, while I considered making slope graphs and box plots, I think the best and most appealing way that the data could be understood is using a scatterplot in this case. Hence, I decided to go with a scatterplot of the Gender Gap in Mobile phone access vs Internet Access to see the relationship between them among different countries and how they stack up overall.

Additionally, I decided to create bar graphs with parameter filters to show the top and bottom 40 countries against each of the parameters according to the interest of the user. I chose the number 40 as it would cover 80 out of 100 countries, that is 80% of the data.
